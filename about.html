                <h2>A History of Leadership</h2>
                <p class="aboutme"> Max Lowenthal has a vast and diverse history in the field of leadership. However, he wasn't always a leadership expert, once he was just an average high school student wanted to make a difference. By taking his first steps into the world of leadership through his religious youth group and private high school, Max discovered he had a talent for leading others. 
                <br><br>
                Max's journey began when he attended his first United Synagouge Youth (USY) Convention in the Fall of 2010. As a new member to the organization, Max was impressed by the attendence and diversity of the event, but knew that the organization was capable of so much more. It was this drive to reach the organization's full potential that led Max to climb the levels of USY's leadership hierachy. Beginning at the local level in his own hometown of St. Paul, MN. He eventually achieved as goal when he reached an International Level position in Online Services for the organiztion. 
                <br><br>
                However, Max wasn't satisfied being a leader in only his religious community, he wanted to make an impact in the other main community in his life: his high school. Max found his leadership outlet in this community through planning social events and assemblies for his high school. Beginning with as a simple 10th Grade Representative postion in his school's Student Activties Commitee, Max once again saw potential for the organization to increase student morale and overall happiness, and took it into his own hands to make it so. By the time he had graduated, Max had become a Co-President of the organization, and planned a number of school wide events that many students and faculty called the best they had ever seen. </p>
